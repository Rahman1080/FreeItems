  <h1>Data Deletion Policy</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <p>The Freeitems app (the "Application"), developed by Abdul Rahman (the "Service Provider"), respects your privacy and is committed to ensuring your control over your personal data. This Data Deletion Policy outlines how users can request the deletion of their personal data collected and stored by the Application.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Deletion Request</h2>
    <p>If you wish to have your personal data removed from the Service Provider's systems, you can make a request by following these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email your request to <a href="mailto:abdulrahmah1080@gmail.com">abdulrahmah1080@gmail.com</a> with the subject line "Data Deletion Request".</li>

          <li>Any additional details to help us identify your data</li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Service Provider will process your request and confirm the deletion within a reasonable time, typically within 14 business days.</p>

      <li>All personally identifiable information will be permanently removed from the Service Provider's active databases.</li>
      <li>Some data may remain in backup archives for legal or compliance purposes but will not be used for any other purpose.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
